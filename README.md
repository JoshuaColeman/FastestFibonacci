# FastestFibonacci

Just a playground to see how fast we can make fibonacci calculations.

There are currently 3 implementations:
- Recursive
- Recursive With Caching
- Iterative

There is a CoreLib assembly, a UnitTest assembly currently, and a Blazor WebUI project that runs the code clientside using webassembly.

The Iterative implementation is the most viable so far.

I reccomend reviewing the unit tests to see the practical limits for values that will complete in this lifetime for the different implementations
